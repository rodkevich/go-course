Lesson_09: &databases
  Let's create an address book DB: >
    Every contact may be described as (Name, Phone, Group)
    Every contact is allowed to be in ONLY ONE group
    Group may contain a lot of contacts
    Groups are predefined by developer
    Usage of any migration package is strongly recommended

  Create a package with functionality:
    - Add contact
    - Assign contact to a group
    - List ALL contacts by group

Lesson_10: *databases
  - just switch to mongo db
