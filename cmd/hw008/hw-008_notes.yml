Lesson_08:
  - Take HomeWork 6 Task 3 as initial step.
  - Create new service to store user-tokens from Web-form
  (no need to use databases. Feel free to use map to store it).
  - Refactor existing POST-request store tokens on new service.
  - New service should store them as structure
   {  token: your token,
      createdAt: currentdate,
      expiredAt: currentdate + 10 days}
  - Make DockerFiles to both services
  - Create account on docker hub.
  - Create images, tag it, upload it on your own hub.
  - Make Docker Compose File
  - Commit DockerFiles and Docker Compose File in Git, open PR.
  S- hare link with your mentors on PR and images in your own docker hub.
  Way to success: Your app should works correct in docker container.
