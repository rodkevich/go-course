  - Lesson_04:
    Implement Shape interface for Circle and Perimeter structs and use it to print information
    about them with the DescribeShape function.
    The result of calling DescribeShape function must output into terminal the following
    for a Circle and Rectangle(the numbers may differ depending on the dimensions you picked)

    Circle: Radius 8.00
    Area: 201.06
    Perimeter: 50.27

    Rectangle with Height 9.00 and Width 3.00
    Area: 27.00
    Perimeter: 24.00

    You must not change the DescribeShape function!
    Hint: To be able to do that you will need to implement fmt.Stringer for your shapes
    Hint #2: you might need to use math.Pi and math.Pow from the math package in the standard go library:
    https://pkg.go.dev/math (this is preferred way, but you definitely can do it without it)
