lesson_07:
  Task_1:
    - RESTful server search call.
    - https://github.com/wshaman/course-rest
    - Using repo above create any kind of search handler.
    (Actual search code we've implemented in gRPC example for reference)
  Task_2:
    - Decide kind of RPC to use (JSON-RPC via HTTP, tcp, XML-RPC, gRPC or any other )
    - Create both server and client.
    Client:
      - may call "register" with name.
    Server:
      - must have a support two endpoints "register" and "list"
      - server saves new name and returns ID of the record.
      - if name is already taken, returns error
      - list end point return whole list of users
      (global slice or map is OK to be a storage in this task.
      DB or saving to file is not required.
      it's OK to reset storage on server stop)
